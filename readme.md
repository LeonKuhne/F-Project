# f
a project to end all projects
#### v0.0

at some point, you will too hit the "oh shit" moment; this is how it should have always been done
when you hit that point, join the cult


### Project Configuration
Sorted by different levels of abstraction:
>view > ctrl > core

Here's the idea, as an ideal:

#### VIEW
- builds 'state'
- html elements 'graphics' logic

#### CTRL
- modifies 'state'
- high level 'business' logic

#### CORE
- no 'state'
- low level 'procedural' logic

#### Why not use MVC?
I am. If you're stuck on naming things a "standardized" way, then you're probably also stuck on using "features" of MVC. All frameworks are starting points meant for deviation; if you design for one or happen upon one. So is this MVC? Idk, are you racist? Life is not not black and white, just hues in-between. Grow up and stop boxing people in. If you still don't understand, then here; It's grouped similarly to MVC, but in no way am I limiting it to the specifications of a [three tier architecture](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/three-tier-architecture).
