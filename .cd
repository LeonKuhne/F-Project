  [  TODO  ]

  fix params 
    - remove param attribute from any references being created
    - pass in the nodes state using 'this' instead of 'x' and get rid of 'x' as a first param
    - make sure optional params work as expected, if not probably need to fix chunk to code to take in the proper/raw params list
    - move parseRefactor from node-manager, or break it up and move as much of it as you can
    - test everything with the js parser

  finish
    - finish up and close the import branch
