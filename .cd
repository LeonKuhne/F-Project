echo "TODO: test parsing other files into modules, including non functions. then fix issues discovered"

in order to properly parse classes
- swap out the 'this' keyword with x
- pass the class object as the second parameter
- only execute functions when all required parameters exist

ideas
> feature:
  - split functions into parts by function calls and create fuctions as groups
  - parse anonymous functions
  - test parsing regular functions
> have a special case for:
  - constructors where you create an object called y, replace 'this' with y and return y
  - class functions where you take in the class object as the first parameter (like self in python) 

later
- pass underscores as the first parameter
