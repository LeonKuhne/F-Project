  [  TODO  ]


  param node
    - map the param node to the second param of all other constructor nodes
    - for parse chunk to code, add an optional returns param; have the returns param added to the code refactoring
    - change code refactoring to happen upon module selection instead
    - remove param attribute from any references being created
    - pass in the nodes state using 'this' instead of 'x' and get rid of 'x' as a first param
    - make sure optional params work as expected, if not probably need to fix chunk to code to take in the proper/raw params list
    - move parseRefactor from node-manager, or break it up and move as much of it as you can

  loops
    - detect loops while parsing that contain references
    - create loop nodes that yield
    - test parsing loops
    
  investigate
    - test everything with the js parser

  finish
    - finish up and close the refactoring branch
    - parse anonymous functions
    - test parsing regular functions
